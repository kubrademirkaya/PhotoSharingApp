# PhotoSharingApp
IOS Project - Photo Sharing App

A photo sharing mobile application was developed for IOS using Swift language.
In the application, more authentication and real-time database operations have been performed. Firebase was used as the database.  
You can log in to the application by registering.  
You can share photos from the Upload section.  
A simple tableview structure is used. You can delete a post by simply pulling it to the left.  
In addition, only the posts shared by the current user are displayed in the profile section.  
Necessary constraints have been created for all Log in, Sign up, Upload etc. operations. In this way, it has been learned how to use alerts.
